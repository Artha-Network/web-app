# Coding Standards

- TypeScript strictness preferred; keep types close to usage.
- No backend or transaction-building logic in web-app; use feature API stubs.
- Document each component with `.md` and `.json` in the same or scoped docs folder.
- Use Tailwind classes; avoid raw CSS files.
- Reuse atoms/molecules; do not duplicate.
- Keep components small, focused, and testable.

### Updates
- v1.0.0 â€” Initial creation
